    "1. Self:<br>\n",
    "In OOP, the term \"self\" refers to the instance of a class that is currently being operated on. It is a reference to the object itself. When we create an object from a class, the object has its own unique properties and values, which we can access using the \"self\" keyword. In other words, \"self\" is a way for us to access the attributes and methods of an object from within the object itself.\n",

    "A method is a function that is associated with a class or an object. It represents a behavior or an action that the object can perform. In Python, methods are defined inside a class and can access the object's attributes using the \"self\" keyword. For example, if we have a Person class, we might define a method called \"speak\" that allows the person to say something.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Constructors:<br>\n",
    "A constructor is a special type of method that is called when an object is created from a class. It is used to initialize the object's attributes and values. In Python, the constructor method is called \"init\" and takes in the \"self\" parameter, as well as any other parameters that we want to use to initialize the object's attributes. For example, if we have a Person class, we might define a constructor that takes in the person's name, age, and gender and initializes those attributes for the object."
